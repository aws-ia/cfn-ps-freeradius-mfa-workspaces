This solution provides the following deployment options:

* https://fwd.aws/Dry5x?[Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new self-managed Active Directory and VPC^]. This option builds a new AWS environment that consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys a self-managed Active Directory and an Amazon WorkSpaces and FreeRADIUS server into this new VPC. The self-managed Active Directory is deployed on Amazon EC2 instances in different availability zones. This Active Directory domain is used to create an AD Connector Directory Service, which is registered for Amazon WorkSpaces. Finally, a FreeRADIUS solution is deployed and MFA is enabled on this AWS Directory Service. 
* https://fwd.aws/NyA9P?[Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new AWS Managed Microsoft AD and VPC^]. This option builds a new AWS environment that consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys a new AWS Managed Microsoft AD Directory Service and a WorkSpaces and FreeRADIUS server into this new VPC. The created AWS Directory Service is registered for WorkSpaces. Finally, a FreeRADIUS solution is deployed and MFA is enabled on this AWS Directory Service. 
* https://fwd.aws/RRN87?[Deploy {partner-product-name} into an existing AWS Directory Service^]. This option deploys an {partner-product-name} solution into an existing VPC. The provided AWS Directory Service is used to register for WorkSpaces if it's not already registered.
* https://fwd.aws/R6JmX?[Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new self-managed Active Directory and existing VPC^]. This option provisions a self-managed Active Directory and a WorkSpaces and FreeRADIUS server in your existing AWS infrastructure.
* https://fwd.aws/WAVEP?[Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new AWS Managed AD and existing VPC^]. This option provisions a new AWS Managed Microsoft AD and a WorkSpaces and FreeRADIUS server in your existing AWS infrastructure.

This solution provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and FreeRADIUS MFA settings.
